## Proposal

Click [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/trending_youtube_viz_R/blob/main/reports/proposal.md) to read the initial motivation and purpose of this dashboard

## Usage

This dashboard features a single landing page with interactive visualizations to provide users with easy access to YouTube video metrics. There is a calendar widget that can be configured to focus on trending videos between a date range. If desired, users can apply an additional filter using the dropdown category menu, which can be parsed by selecting and/or searching for topics of interest. These filters will update the settings for each plot and table, allowing for improved visibility and interpretation of trends over time.

Note: As I'm based in Canada, I am using data extracted from videos that were trending in Canada due to file size limitations and for ease of loading/extraction. However, given the flexibility of this web app, it can be easily extended to YouTube data from other countries.
