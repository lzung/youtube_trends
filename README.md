## Proposal

Click [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/trending_youtube_viz_R/blob/main/reports/proposal.md) to read the initial motivation and purpose of this dashboard.

## Dashboard Features

This dashboard features a single landing page that allows users to easily visualize YouTube video metrics. There is a calendar widget that can be configured to focus on trending videos between a date range. If desired, users can apply an additional filter using the dropdown category menu, which can be parsed by selecting and/or searching for topics of interest. These filters will update the settings for each plot and table, allowing for improved visibility and interpretation of trends over time. Aggregate counts of the number of videos and channels are also displayed to provide a comprehensive overview on the amount of data points displayed.

## Usage

To run this dashboard locally and/or use your own data collected from the YouTube API, clone this repository and download the environment found [here](https://github.com/lzung/youtube_trends/blob/main/environment.yaml) to install the necessary [dependencies](#dependencies).

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lzung/youtube_trends.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository

4. Navigate to the `src` folder and run `app.py` to render the dashboard locally. If you want to add your own dataset, first import your data (as a `.csv`), then run the `feature_engineering.py` script to export before deploying the dashboard.

```bash
cd src
python3 app.py
```

Note: As I'm based in Canada, I am using data extracted from videos that were trending in Canada due to file size limitations and for ease of loading/extraction. However, given the flexibility of this web app, it can be easily extended to YouTube data from other countries.
